# Simple Python HTTP Server

This project demonstrates how to create a basic HTTP server in Python using the built-in http.server and socketserver modules. The server runs on port 8000 and serves files from the current directory.

📌 Features

Lightweight local HTTP server

No external libraries required

Serves files from the working directory

Great for testing, development, or static websites

🚀 How to Run

Save the file as server.py

Open terminal in the same directory

Run:

python3 server.py


Open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:8000

📄 Requirements

Python 3.x

No additional packages needed

🧰 How It Works

SimpleHTTPRequestHandler handles file serving

TCPServer binds to port 8000

serve_forever() keeps the server running

📌 Stopping the Server

Press CTRL + C in the terminal.
